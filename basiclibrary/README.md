* # Arrays, Loops, Imports, Array
### In today lab we start dealing with arrays and creating methods to do some functionality like :
#### 1. In the first method which called roll that we need to create an array with knowing length the length for the array we proved it as an argument then this method will generate array with random num and return this array.
#### 2. In this method contains Duplicates the function check if the passed array contain duplicates or not .
#### 3. In arrayAvg method  this method reserve array and do a summation  for each index in this array and return the average.
#### 4.In the last method  we have a 2d array, and we need to loop in it and calculate the average for each array inside this 2d array and retern with the array which have a lowest avarage.

* # Maps and File I/O

### In this part for lab Three we start working in map list and know how its work and know some property that use with it.
#### 1. The first method called  Weather that take an 2d array and search for the minimum, and the maximum  in the array.
#### 2. The second method called tally this method using a  Map with a key and value and each time call the same kay we will increase the value for this key.
#### 3. Then we wil return a string with the key which have the highest value.
