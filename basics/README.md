## In today lab we learnd how we can start working in java and how to do the initialization for  it then we start review some basics that we take it before like if statement and for loop.

## In the lab time it was required  from us to do some task need some logic to solve but it was not that hard, we start with deal with a function that return a string then we call this function to show a certin sentence, Then we deal with function that generate a random number to pick heads or tail depending in the number that we get, After that we created a watch that give the time every second.

> ### If you want to run this project you need to run this command (./gradlew run) in the basics directory and its will show you the output
