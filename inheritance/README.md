# Inheritance and Interfaces
### In today lab we get interduecd to vary important topic in oop which is Inheritance.

### What we did in the lab is the following :
* #### `Restaurant class :` in this class we create  a variable that we are need and the constructor  and we create a method to add revios and change the number for stars.
* #### `Review class:` this class is  adding reviews for other  restaurant and shop and theater 
* #### `shop class:`Also this class do as the Restaurant.
* #### `Theater class: ` this class to show details for theater and for adding reviews.
### So what we will do is add a review for a  restaurant in the review you need to add the restaurant name and number of stars, and the price to show full review massage, what will happen when you do that is that instance will go to the review class then to contactor in the contract we're passing the information now we have the review we need to call the method to see the review.
